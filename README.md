# 🏗 UrbanShield – Unauthorized Construction Detection

UrbanShield is an AI-powered system that detects **unauthorized construction** across the city. It uses **computer vision, geospatial data, and real-time monitoring** to identify violations and alert authorities.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **AI-Based Detection** – Identifies illegal construction from satellite/drone images  
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Tracks urban development using Kafka & Redis  
✅ **Automated Alerts** – Sends instant notifications to city officials  
✅ **GraphDB Integration** – Efficiently stores and queries spatial data
